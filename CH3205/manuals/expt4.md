**Safety Precautions:**
* Wear safety goggles and gloves at all times.
* Handle chemicals in a fume hood where appropriate.
* Copper compounds can be irritating; avoid skin contact and inhalation.
* Isopropyl alcohol and ethanol are flammable; keep away from open flames.
* The product is hygroscopic; minimize exposure to air.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Dissolve Reactants:**
    * Weighed 2.21 g (0.0201 mol) of diethylammonium chloride into a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Added 15 mL of isopropyl alcohol. Gently heated the mixture on a hot plate with swirling until the solid dissolved completely. Solution was colorless.
    * Weighed 1.70 g (0.00997 mol) of copper(II) chloride dihydrate (blue-green solid) into a 25 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Added 3 mL of absolute ethanol. Gently heated on a hot plate with swirling until dissolved. Solution was green.
2.  **Mix and Cool:**
    * While both solutions were still warm/hot, carefully poured the green copper chloride solution into the colorless diethylammonium chloride solution.
    * The mixture immediately turned a bright, clear green.
    * Placed the flask containing the mixture into an ice-water bath to cool.
3.  **Crystallization:**
    * As the solution cooled in the ice bath, bright green, needle-like crystals began to form rapidly.
    * Allowed the flask to sit in the ice bath for ~15 minutes to maximize crystal formation.
4.  **Isolation:**
    * Set up a Büchner funnel with filter paper for vacuum filtration.
    * Filtered the green crystals under vacuum. The filtrate was pale green.
    * Rinsed the crystals in the funnel with a small portion (~3 mL) of cold isopropyl alcohol.
    * Allowed air to be pulled through the crystals on the filter paper for ~5 minutes to partially dry them.
5.  **Drying and Storage:**
    * Transferred the green crystals from the filter paper to a pre-weighed watch glass (Watch glass mass = 45.12 g).
    * Placed the watch glass with the product into a desiccator containing drying agent (e.g., anhydrous CaCl₂).
    * *Later:* Weighed the watch glass with the dried product. Mass = 48.15 g.

**Observations:**

* Diethylammonium chloride dissolved readily in warm isopropyl alcohol to give a colorless solution.
* Copper(II) chloride dihydrate (blue-green solid) dissolved in warm ethanol to give a clear green solution.
* Mixing the hot solutions resulted in a vibrant green solution.
* Upon cooling in an ice bath, fine, bright green needles precipitated quickly.
* The final, dried product consisted of bright green, needle-like crystals.
* When a small sample of the green crystals was gently warmed on a spatula (or melting point apparatus), it turned a distinct yellow color around 40-50°C. The color reverted to green upon cooling.

**Data:**

* Mass of Diethylammonium chloride = 2.21 g
* Mass of Copper(II) chloride dihydrate = 1.70 g
* Mass of Watch glass = 45.12 g
* Mass of Watch glass + Dried Product = 48.15 g
* Mass of Dried Product (Actual Yield) = 48.15 g - 45.12 g = 3.03 g

**Calculations:**

1.  **Limiting Reactant:** CuCl₂·2H₂O (0.00997 mol) vs Diethylammonium chloride (0.0201 mol needed / 2 = 0.01005 mol available based on CuCl₂). CuCl₂·2H₂O is limiting.
2.  **Theoretical Yield:**
    * Moles of product = Moles of CuCl₂·2H₂O = 0.00997 mol
    * Theoretical Mass = 0.00997 mol * 353.65 g/mol = 3.53 g
3.  **Percent Yield:**
    * Percent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) * 100%
    * Percent Yield = (3.03 g / 3.53 g) * 100% = 85.8%

**Results and Conclusion:**

Bis(diethylammonium)tetrachlorocuprate(II) was successfully synthesized as bright green, needle-like crystals. The actual yield obtained was 3.03 g, corresponding to a percent yield of 85.8%. The product exhibited the expected thermochromic behavior, changing from green to yellow upon gentle heating and reverting to green upon cooling, consistent with a solid-state phase transition involving a change in the coordination geometry of the [CuCl₄]²⁻ anion. The product is hygroscopic and was stored in a desiccator. Samples were retained for further analysis (DSC, UV-Vis, IR).
